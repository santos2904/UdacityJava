//Create a Polygon class. A polygon is a closed shape with lines joining the corner points.
//You will keep the points in an array list. Use object of java.awt.Point for the point.

//Polygon will have as an instance variable an ArrayList of Points to hold the points
//The constructor takes no parameters but initializes the instance variable.  The
//Polygon class also has the following methods:
//    add: adds a Point to the polygon
//    perimeter: returns the perimeter of the polygon
//    draw: draws the polygon by connecting consecutive points and then
//          connecting the last point to the first.
//
//No methods headers or javadoc is provided this time. You get to try your hand at writing
//a class almost from scratch

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.awt.Point;

public class Polygon
{
    // TODO: provide the required constructor, instance variable, and methods
