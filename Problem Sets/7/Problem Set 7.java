1. Write the code to declare an array of doubles called prices
double[] prices;


2. Complete the statement to create an array of ints called scores that can hold 50 ints
int[] scores = new int[50];


3. double[] temperatures = new double[12];
What is the length of the array, that is how many elements can it hold?
12


4.  double[] temperatures = new double[12];
What is the initial value at index 5? 
0


5. double[] temperatures = new double[12];
Complete this code to print the element at index 9:
System.out.println(temperatures[9]); 

6. Write the statement to assign 95 to the first element of an int array scores
scores[0] = 95;

7.  Complete the code to initialise an array containing the prime numbers less than 10.
int[] primes = {2, 3, 5, 7};

8. double[] temperatures = new double[12];
the indexes can range from 0 to 11.
